Planets are large celestial bodies that orbit a star, like Earth around the Sun. Moons are smaller objects that orbit planets, like the Moon around Earth. Stars are giant balls of burning gas that produce light and heat, with the Sun being the closest one to us. Asteroids are rocky objects floating in space, mostly found between Mars and Jupiter. Comets are icy bodies that develop tails when they get close to the Sun. There is also cosmic dust, tiny particles scattered across space. All these together form the universe we see in the night sky.",
